Q: Why do we use Tableau?

A: We use Tableau for data visualization and business intelligence, as it helps to:
- Connect to various data sources
- Create interactive dashboards
- Analyze and visualize data
- Gain insights and make data-driven decisions

1. What is the difference between a measure and a dimension in Tableau?

A measure is a field that can be aggregated (e.g., Sales, Profit), while a dimension is a  field that provides context (e.g., Region, Product).

2. Provide an example of discrete data in a sales dataset.

Number of products sold or Product categories (e.g., Electronics, Clothing) are examples of discrete data.

4. Can a date field be treated as both discrete and continuous in Tableau? How?

Yes, a date field can be treated as both discrete (e.g., individual dates or date parts like year, month) and continuous (e.g., a continuous date range).

Q: What is the difference between 1D and 2D data structures in pandas?

A: In pandas:

- 1D (Series): A one-dimensional labeled array, similar to a column in a spreadsheet. It has a single column of data with row labels (index).
- 2D (DataFrame): A two-dimensional labeled data structure, similar to an Excel spreadsheet or a table in a relational database. It has rows and columns, with both row labels (index) and column labels.
